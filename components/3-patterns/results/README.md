## When to use this component

The select component should only be used as a last resort in public-facing services because research shows that some users find selects very difficult to use.

## How it works

The select component allows users to choose an option from a long list. Before using the select component, try asking users questions which will allow you to present them with fewer options.

Asking questions means youâ€™re less likely to need to use the select component, and can consider using a different solution, such as [radios](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/radios/).
