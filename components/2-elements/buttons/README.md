# Rationale
Buttons are used to direct the user to perform a specific interaction. The copy used on the button should be clear, concise and direct.

## Variants

#### Primary
The primary button is used for the primary action for the user's context e.g to start a survey.

#### Secondary
Secondary buttons should be used for supplementary actions which users can take. Secondary buttons cannot exist without a primary button in the same context.

#### Group

The `btn--group` wrapper class can be added with the `btn--group__item` element class when primary and secondary actions need to sit side-by-side.
